To continuously run the sl command on Ubuntu, you can use a loop in the terminal. The sl command displays a train animation in the terminal. Here's how you can run it continuously:

Open a terminal window on your Ubuntu system.
Use the following command to run sl continuously in a loop:
bash
Copy code
while true; do sl; done
This command runs sl repeatedly in an infinite loop. Each time sl finishes running, it starts again.

Here's how you can stop it:

Press Ctrl + C on your keyboard to terminate the loop and stop sl from running.
Here's an example:

bash
Copy code
while true; do sl; done
When you run this command in the terminal, the train animation (sl) will continuously run until you stop the loop.
